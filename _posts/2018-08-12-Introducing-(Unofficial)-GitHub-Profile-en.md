Recently I have been busy developing and improving the [github-profile](https://github.com/joytou/github-profile) project. why? Because I want to simplify the information page of my blog, otherwise I will change some information here and there, it will inevitably forget some places. And just happened to find the [mdo/github-buttons](https://github.com/mdo/github-buttons) open source project, relying on the idea of ​​the github-buttons project, slowly pondering the github-profile project.

So now, I want to share it with everyone and get feedback from everyone.


## Features
Display your GitHub account profile with the official GitHub page style.


## how to use
Just add an `iframe` and some URL parameters. Is not it easily? More importantly, it's hosted on GitHub Pages, which means you don't need to host your own code. Just add it and you're ready to use. Of course, it can also selectively hide or show specific items, and it can automatically adjust the height. 

<iframe id="fr" src="//github-profile.joytou.net/gh-profile/?user=joytou&bio=true&locations=true&blog=true&email=true&company=false&iframeid=fr" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="240" width="100%"></iframe>

The profile above is live example of shown Bio, Location, Blog address, Email and auto-adjust height. Other than this, you can choose to shown your company(organizations) too.
